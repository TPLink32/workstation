On this page you can find links to binaries of the latest version of Lua. The current version is <em>Lua 5.2.3</em>.<p>
If you would like to build or embed Lua yourself you may want to look at notes on <a href="BuildingLua.htm" tppabs="http://lua-users.org/wiki/BuildingLua" >BuildingLua</a>. Modified versions of Lua with extra functionality/libraries can be found on <a href="LuaDistributions.htm" tppabs="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaDistributions" >LuaDistributions</a>.<p>

<hr>Notes to kind souls adding links:<UL>
<li> Please only add links to the <em>latest version</em> of Lua.<li> Only add vanilla versions of Lua, i.e. with <em>minimal</em> or no changes. Slight modification purely to allow execution on a particular platform is clearly acceptable. Sweeping changes and added features mean you are developing your own distribution, which should be added to <a href="LuaDistributions.htm" tppabs="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaDistributions" >LuaDistributions</a>.<li> Platforms and packages are listed alphabetically.</UL>
