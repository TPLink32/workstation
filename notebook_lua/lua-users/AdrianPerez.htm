<li> <strong>Simple script to demonstrate Lua capabilities:</strong> I like to get my colleagues frightened with the Jedi powers of Lua by showing them this filter script that puts line numbers in the standard input. Once they saw the script of <strong>only</strong> five lines, I always ask to them: "How many lines do you need to do the same in C?" Here it is (requires Lua 5.0):</UL>
<pre>
        i = 1;
        for line in io.readlines() do
           print(i .. ": ", line);
           i = i+1;
        end

for (int i=1, b[100];;i++) printf("%d: %s\n",i,gets((char*)b));
</pre><dt><dd><em>Or one line in Lua: --NDT</em><dt><dd><pre>
while 1 do i=(i or 0)+1 print(""..i..": "..io.read()) end

<dt><dd><em>Yeah, you'll right ;), but the C code will crash if you use the program over a file with lines longer than the size of the buffer, and you need to declare the <code>main()</code> function and include <code>stdio.h</code>... Maybe I often worry too much about code correctness and maybe that script was not a good example after all :P -- Adrian</em></DL>

<DL>
<dt><dd><em>Well.. I don't think any of the last examples given may pass as one line of code. Going like that you can collapse a whole file onto i single line.. Don't get me wrong, I still find it very neat and I like Lua alot :o)</em></DL>

<H3>Ideas for Stuff</H3>
Ideas, ideas: ideas I had but they didn't work, or didn't implement them, or... as I want to work on Lixoo I don't have spare time to these.<p>
<UL>
<li> <strong>Build system:</strong> I agree with <a href="/wiki/JohnBelmonte" >JohnBelmonte</a> that a Lua-based build system could be very cool stuff. I had this idea without knowing that he had it too. I coded some time ago a bunch scripts and called it SBS (Scriptable Build System), but I never released it as it had lots of obscure things and didn't work well. I think that the building system can be done by coding a library to do certain system calls (especially those related to knowing modification dates of files) from Lua and packaging them with a custom Lua interpreter especially designed to perform builds of software.</UL><DL>
