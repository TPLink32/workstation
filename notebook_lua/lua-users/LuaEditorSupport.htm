It is known to work with Epsilon 13, and probably works with some earlier versions as well. Save the liked file locally as luamode.e, compile to bytecode and load into the running Epsilon state with the compile-buffer command (which is probably bound to Alt+F3). Save the modified state file as usual (with the write-state command). The resulting major mode handles simple syntax highlighting and code indentation cases, but it does have blind spots and limitations.  </UL>

Add code-folding ability by adding these lines to the syntax highlighting file above:<p>
/Open Fold Strings = "{"/Close Fold Strings = "}"<p>
