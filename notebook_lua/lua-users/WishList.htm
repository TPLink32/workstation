Projects that should exist for Lua, either as modifications to the language core, or as libraries.  Please don't use the page to discuss changes to Lua syntax or semantics, warts of the language, and other such nebulous things, but instead for projects that should be, things that can be defined clearly.<p>

<li> XMPP client library: Similar to the "Smack" library for java (high level calls "send this message to this person", "Log on to this server as this user with this password" etc.) would be nice.</UL>

Something on the scale of numpy or PDL is probably beyond the scope of Lua, but basic support for true arrays would be a perfect fit for a language that's small and fast!  A 1-dimensional array type is a quick one-off with tolua (and exists in the angband sources), but 2d matrices and beyond are much more involved and tricky. </UL>

<li> A date/time manipulation library.  Should be in lua for portability.  The <a href="CalendricalCalculations.htm" tppabs="http://lua-users.org/wiki/CalendricalCalculations" >CalendricalCalculations</a> code works on dates but not times.</UL>

<li> meta.add(table1, function (a, b) return {value=a.value+b.value} end). This seems neater to me than __add, and is trivial to implement - as a wrapper around the current metatables semantics, not a replacement. <em>Wrappers are superfluous. They take code space and do not add functionality. It's easy enough to add this to your program yourself, if you really need to.

<li> Pickling/unpickling.  Should be in C for speed but overrideable.
