<H3>Lua 5.1/5.0 Compiler in C</H3>
<p>
The original C parser of Lua, of course, exists in the source code of the Lua distribution, but it is hand-written in C and not easy to reuse.<p>

<H3>Lua 5.1 Parser in Lua</H3>
<p>
The mlp parser, included in <a href="MetaLua.htm" tppabs="http://lua-users.org/wiki/MetaLua" >MetaLua</a>, can parse Lua (as well as Lua with syntax extensions) and convert it into an AST.  mlp is built on top of the gg grammar generator, which can build <em>extensible</em> parsers with user-defined grammars.  mlp and gg are written entirely in Lua, and its lexer is based on Yueliang (below).  gg/mlp is used, for example, in <a href="MetaLua.htm" tppabs="http://lua-users.org/wiki/MetaLua" >MetaLua</a> and <a href="LuaToCee.htm" tppabs="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaToCee" >LuaToCee</a>.<p>

It includes a parser that understands the complete syntax of Lua 5.1.  (The PEG appears to be an effort that predates LPeg.)<p>
<a href="LuaBalanced.htm" tppabs="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaBalanced" >LuaBalanced</a> provides some functions that match delimited snippets of Lua code in a string.  It avoids rigorously lexing and parsing the Lua grammar by assuming the Lua code is syntactically correct (which can be verified later using <code>loadstring</code>).<p>

<p>

This seems like a nice start for reusing in your own things that need a Lua interpreter in C++. The author has abandoned the project, and the above is the latest version as of February 2004.In February 2005, I looked at this grammar closer to try to use it. There are a number of problems with it:<p>
<UL>
<li> id's can start with _. Easy to fix.<li> Escaped ' and " inside strings are not working. Easy to fix.<li> Comments can only appear at statement level. A work-around is to add it to expressions and fields rules, which improves things a lot. Make sure to do *( comment ) instead of just comment to handle comments after each other.<li> Long comments --[[ ]] are not supported. Easy to fix by changing comment to shortcomment and longcomment. Make sure to put longcomment first, because spirit is eager.<li> a[b] = 2 does not parse. Some function calls are not parsed correctly, i.e. a(b)(). It seems that the refactoring of the left recursion with prefixexp is not done correctly. I have failed to fix this.</UL>
<p>
The last point is a show-stopper for me. Thus I have failed to make Spirit parse Lua correctly.<p>
-- Asger Ottar Alstrup (aalstrup at laerdal.dk)<p>
There is another spirit parser that I wrote for SZARP SCADA system. It is tested mostly for simplecases when we can bypass actual lua and execute statments without resorting to vm, but generally it seemsto be doing all right. It should not suffer from deficiencies mentioned above and is written usinglatest spirit API. It may be a little difficult to use right away because it is a part of largersystem but still its dependencies are rather minimal. <p>
