Metalua brings a macro system into Lua for compile-time metaprogramming (CTMP).  There is also a preliminary implementation of <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://blog.davber.com/2006/09/07/embedded-lisp-via-lua/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://blog.davber.com/2006/09/07/embedded-lisp-via-lua/%27" tppabs="http://blog.davber.com/2006/09/07/embedded-lisp-via-lua/">[Lisp in Lua]</a>.<p>
For those comfortable with Scheme, Guile may be a better solution.  Lua has a bent towards scripting and configuration by "non-programmers", where infix syntax may be more appealing.  Lua is also often used as a stand-alone language, which in the Scheme world is more the domain of scsh than Guile. Guile is significantly larger than Lua.<p>
