For example, on Linux, <code>clock</code> gives "CPU time" <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Time-Basics.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Time-Basics.html#Time-Basics%27" tppabs="http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Time-Basics.html#Time-Basics">[2]</a><a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://linux.die.net/man/3/clock  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://linux.die.net/man/3/clock%27" tppabs="http://linux.die.net/man/3/clock">[3]</a>, which only counts the time in which the process is actively using the CPU and does not count time executing other processes or waiting for I/O.  CPU time may be less than the real time ("wall clock time").  On Windows, <code>clock</code> counts real (wall clock) time since the start of the process <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4e2ess30.aspx  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4e2ess30.aspx%27" tppabs="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4e2ess30.aspx">[4]</a>.  On Windows and Linux, the resolution on <code>clock</code> is on the order of milliseconds, which is more precise than the <code>time</code> function, but on other systems it may be only one second resolution.  The <code>clock</code> value will also wrap around on overflow, depending on the size of the data type used to represent <code>clock_t</code>.  Sometimes this function is more useful than <code>os.time</code> for benchmarking: <code>local clock = os.clock; local t1 = clock(); dosomething(); local dt = clock() - t1</code> .</UL>
