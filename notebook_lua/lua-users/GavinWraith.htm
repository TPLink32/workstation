I retired from a Readership in Mathematics at <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.sussex.ac.uk/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.sussex.ac.uk/%27" tppabs="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/">[Sussex
University]</a> (UK) in 1999. I was chairman of the newlyfounded department of Computer Science in 1985.<p>
I think Sussex was the first place in the UK to usemicros for maths teaching - in the late 70s. My ownfirst micro was an Acorn Atom (with 12K user RAM!).I got interested in functional programming languages,and was amazed at the convergence of ideas betweenadvances in design of FP languages and category theory.I was a founding member of the <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wra1th.plus.com/gcw/rants/math/PSSL/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wra1th.plus.com/gcw/rants/math/PSSL/%27" tppabs="http://www.wra1th.plus.com/gcw/rants/math/PSSL/">[PSSL]</a> (PeripateticSeminar on Sheaves and Logic) which trained a wholegeneration of computer scientists - it grew out ofDana Scott's seminar at Oxford.<p>
Like <a href="/wiki/ReubenThomas" >ReubenThomas</a> I have always been fascinated by smallelegant languages and virtual machines. I was long onthe lookout for something to improve upon the BBC Basicbuilt into <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.riscos.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.riscos.org/%27" tppabs="http://www.riscos.org/">[RISC OS]</a>. Lua was the answer to my prayers.I devised <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://lua.riscos.org.uk/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://lua.riscos.org.uk/%27" tppabs="http://lua.riscos.org.uk/">[RiscLua]</a> as a port of Lua to Risc OS with theminimum extensions necessary to give it the samefunctionality as BBC Basic for access to the operating system.You can find a tutorial on it at <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wra1th.plus.com/lua/book/contents.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wra1th.plus.com/lua/book/contents.html%27" tppabs="http://www.wra1th.plus.com/lua/book/contents.html">[RiscLua tutorial]</a>.<p>
