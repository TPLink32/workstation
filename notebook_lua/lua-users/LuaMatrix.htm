M^x (for matrix M and <em>complex</em> x) is in general defined as expm(logm(M)*x), just like in the real and complex cases.  logm and expm <a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/logm.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Ultra, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/logm.html%27" tppabs="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/logm.html">[9]</a> can be understood as Taylor expansions in terms of non-negative integer powers of M (again, analogous to the real and complex cases).
