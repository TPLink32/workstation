<em><a href="/wiki/LuaDirectory" >LuaDirectory</a> &gt; <a href="/wiki/LuaAddons" >LuaAddons</a> &gt;</em> Lua<code></code>Distributions<hr>This is a list of Lua distributions.  These typically consist of Lua plus libraries, often for a certain platform (e.g. POSIX or Windows-specific) and often in binary form (but may have sources too).<p>
<em>For vanilla Lua binaries (without add-ons) compiled for various platforms, see <a href="/wiki/LuaBinaries" >LuaBinaries</a>. For alternative Lua compilers and Lua VM implementations, see <a href="/wiki/LuaImplementations" >LuaImplementations</a>.</em><p>
<em>Please do not reference minor Lua version numbers in entries.  That detail is not important here and only necessitates more maintenance of this page.</em> <p>
